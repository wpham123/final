            <p>
            </p>Some challenges that can rise from ChatGPT are the use of unfairness and bias. Some people use ChatGPT for information on topics that are not regularly discussed such as political topics. ChatGPT can come off as biased with the responses and can be taken to be unfair responses. A strategy for this can be to make sure the training data is fair and diverse. Along with checking to see how people word their requests and matching the responses with the tone and manner of the request with the proper and accurate information. 
        
            <h2>Mitigating Risks and Maximizing Benefits</h2>
        When using AI it is very easy to mitigate harm due to its programed system but maximizing its benefits is something that needs to be navigated. Some recommendations for using ChatGPT  are to know what you are using, Meaning to have a clear understanding of its capabilities and its capacity. To be compliant with regulations meaning to open communication with users and the community while engaging in feedback and collaborating with the challenges that may come with using AI.

            <h2>Looking Ahead: The Impact on Society and Industry</h2>
            <p>
                   <p> ChatGPT getting better in the future can be good and not so good for people and businesses. On the good side, it might help us work better, learn more easily, and make things like customer service and creative work more awesome. But, it could also lead to some people losing their jobs, and if we rely too much on ChatGPT to make decisions, it might cause problems. We need to be careful about privacy and security too, making sure it's used in a fair and safe way. To make sure it helps more than hurts, we should teach and learn new things, follow good rules, and make sure everyone gets a fair chance to use and benefit from it.
