            <h1>Deep Dive into ChatGPT</h1>
            <h2>Overview of ChatGPT</h2>
            <p>ChatGPT is an input and response based AI designed to receive a prompt and then give a suitable response and answer. Launched on November 30, 2022, and created by OpenAI, ChatGPT is a generative pre-trained transformer, meaning it pulls from a dataset with prior training to generate a response based on the user's request. ChatGPT has become one of the largest and fastest-growing softwares in the world due to its quick and often reliable answers.</p>
            <h2>Why We Chose ChatGPT</h2>
            <p>As college students, everyone knows about ChatGPT and how it can be used. Seeing as we major in IT or another Computer/Engineering discipline, ChatGPT seemed like the perfect subject to evaluate. The potential impact it can have on the future is astronomical, and we wanted to explore both the negative and the positive aspects of the software. Is it too easy, will it lead to less qualified individuals, does it have the potential to do more harm than good? The potential is endless and quite fascinating to say the least.</p>
